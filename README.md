# ADC-ISR-Manipulation-Analyzing-Performance-Variation
Compares routines in C versus assembler in terms of efficiency and functionality, as well as comparing hardware and software methods of receiving an input value. This project also shows the use of assembler functions, special registers and internal hardware specifically relating to the AVR instruction set.
