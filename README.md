# ADC-ISR-Manipulation-Analyzing-Performance-Variation

This project used a breadboarded 8-bit ATMEGA328P microprocessor and was developed  in MPLABX using a mix of C and assembler. The project implements three different routines/methods to output a in response to moving a potentiometer or button. This projectâ€™s focus is to compare routines in C versus assembler in terms of efficiency and functionality, as well as comparing hardware and software methods of receiving an input value. This project also shows the use of assembler functions, special registers and internal hardware specifically relating to the AVR instruction set.
